# Roadmap (Conceptual)

This roadmap outlines **possible future directions** for the AI Task Orchestrator.
It is intentionally **non-committal** and represents ideas, not promises.

The current MVP focuses on orchestration patterns and traceability.

---

## Current State (MVP)

The MVP demonstrates:
- intent-based routing across a small set of tools
- clear result summaries
- transparent execution traces
- explicit scope boundaries

The goal at this stage is **concept validation**, not completeness.

---

## Near-Term Possibilities

Future iterations could explore:

- **Additional tools**
  - domain-specific analyzers
  - validation and policy-checking tools
  - workflow-oriented helpers

- **Richer orchestration logic**
  - configurable routing rules
  - hybrid LLM + rule-based decisions
  - confidence-based fallbacks

- **Improved trace detail**
  - standardized trace schemas
  - exportable traces for review or audit
  - trace summarization for non-technical users

---

## Mid-Term Possibilities

If evolved further, the concept could extend to:

- **Domain-specific orchestrators**
  - finance, QA, compliance, operations, etc.
  - embedded domain constraints and terminology

- **Context integration**
  - external APIs
  - structured data sources
  - knowledge bases or RAG-style retrieval

- **Workflow support**
  - multi-step task execution
  - approvals and checkpoints
  - human-in-the-loop patterns

---

## Out of Scope (Intentionally)

The following are **explicitly out of scope** for the current MVP:
- production hardening
- enterprise security and access control
- SLAs and operational monitoring
- real customer or organizational data

---

## Guiding Principle

The roadmap prioritizes:
- clarity over breadth
- explainability over automation
- trust over novelty

Any future evolution should preserve these principles.
