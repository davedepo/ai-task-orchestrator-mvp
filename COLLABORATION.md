# Collaboration & Demos

This repository is a **documentation-only MVP**.

The purpose of this public space is to explain the concept, behavior, and
architectural direction of the AI Task Orchestrator.  
All implementation code is maintained in a private repository.

---

## Demos & Walkthroughs

Walkthroughs and demos of the MVP are available **on request**.

Typical demo discussions may include:
- Architectural overview of the orchestrator
- Tool routing and traceability design
- Review of example use cases shown in this repository
- Discussion of how the concept could evolve into a domain-specific solution

---

## How to Start a Discussion

Please use **GitHub Discussions** for all collaboration or demo requests.

When starting a discussion, it is helpful (but not required) to include:
- Your area of interest (e.g., architecture, engineering, operations, governance)
- The type of discussion you are looking for (overview, demo, exploratory chat)
- Any domain context you are curious about (purely hypothetical is fine)

No sensitive or proprietary information should be shared.

## Scope Note

This MVP is intentionally limited in scope.

Any future extensions (domain logic, integrations, data sources, workflows)
would be discussed conceptually first and are **not implied** by the current
implementation.
